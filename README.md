# SPRINT1.02 Java Exceptions 
The main objective is to practice the full exception handling flow. We practice declaring and throwing (throws/throw) a custom exception,
and then ensuring its capture and management using the try-catch block.
---

## 📌 Exercise Statement

The goal is to model a sales system (`Sale`, `Product`) and ensure robustness through error handling:
  - The `Sale.calculateTotal()` method must throw the custom exception `EmptySaleException` if the list of products is empty.
  - The `Main` class must demonstrate controlled error handling by catching both the custom exception and the `IndexOutOfBoundsException`.
 Handling of collection errors (invalid index).
